"""Test fixtures. Everything runs against the OFFLINE blind sandbox (no account, no live
endpoint): a fresh SaihmMemoryClient with no SAIHM_ENDPOINT_URL spins up a local in-process
blind endpoint via the bundled Node sidecar.

One sandbox client is shared for the whole session (a Node subprocess spawn is not free); each
test starts from a clean slate via the autouse ``_wipe`` fixture.

Targets the CURRENT CrewAI memory API (``crewai.memory.storage.backend.StorageBackend``,
``crewai.memory.types.MemoryRecord``, ``crewai.memory.storage.factory``). CrewAI replaced the
older ``storage.interface.Storage`` / ``ExternalMemory`` surface between 1.9 and 1.15, so there
is no ``ExternalMemory`` fixture here -- the drop-in is proven through the factory hook instead.
